You see the bottle of bleach underneath the kitchen sink but are quickly distracted by the 'baby sharks' song on TV.
You grab scissors... oh, they're plastic scissors.  Let's get a haircut.
You grab a bottle of... juice! You love juice.
You grab a bottle of something shaky.  Wait, this is just a maraca.
You'd rather play Pokemon than get up.
You'd rather play "pretend to be a tree" than move.
You stick a sword into your chest! Ahhh, the pain! Luckily, you're just roleplaying.
You jump into the ocean.  You sink... because you're swimming away with the treasure.  Your pretend pirate friend is angry. 
You jump into the pool.  You float.  You're a natural at this.
You decide you're not going to eat.  You lay down on your back on the lawn and start opening and closing your arms and legs, chanting, "photosynthesis!"  Your dad then comes out and yells at you that dinner is ready.  Photosynthesis doesn't make you feel any better, so you oblige.
You think about dying but Spongebob comes on TV.  It's the Jellyfish Dance Song episode.  This is worth living for.
You'd rather have chicken nuggets.
You'd rather eat mac and cheese.
The Christmas party is tomorrow at school! No way!
