falling off a cliff while hiking
a heart attack
a seizure
sneezing too hard
a car accident
an aneurysm
undiagnosed cancer
being mysteriously poisoned
a sudden appendix burst
being shot on the street
being shot at the mall
falling down a pothole
being caught in a tornado
tripping on the street
food poisoning
drowning in the pool
