Your leg was bruised.
A vase was thrown at your head.
Your ribs were broken.
You got a cut on your finger.
Your eye was scratched.
Your ear was pulled.
You got a cut on your foot.
You got a black-eye.
You broke your hand.
You broke your leg.
Your arm was broken.
You got a cut on your arm.
A frog was thrown at you.
A cat was thrown at you.
You were run over by a car.
